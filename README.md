# Rotable Monkey for Minetest

This is an example mod that includes a rotatable monkey head node that can be
rotated with a monkey head rotator tool.

When wielding a monkey rotator:
* Punch (left-click) to rotate clockwise.
* Place (right-click) to rotate anticlockwise.
* Hold sneak to rotate in increments of 22.5°.
* Hold Aux1 (special) to rotate in increments of 45°. Sneak takes precedence
over Aux1.
